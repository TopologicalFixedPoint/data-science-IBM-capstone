The business problem that I am hoping to solve is whether there is a correlation 
between stops on public transportation and the quantity of restaurants. The end goal is to build a recommender system 
that can recommend locations to open a new store. The target demographic is small business owners
who could use advice to open a location to expand. THerefore, business owners in the restaurant industry
will be interested in this project.
