The business problem that I am hoping to solve is whether there is a correlation 
between stops on public transportation and the quantity of restaurants. The problem is 
guiding a prospective business owner where the optimal location to open a restaurant based 
on what the restaurant menu. The goal is to prove whether a prospective business 
owner should open a restaurant near public transportation.
The target audience is business owners who are thinking about where to start their businesses.
