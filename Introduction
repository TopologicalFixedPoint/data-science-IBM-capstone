The business problem that I am hoping to solve is whether there is a correlation 
between stops on public transportation and the quantity of restaurants.

The end goal is to build a recommender system 
that can recommend locations to open a new store. The target demographic is small business owners
who could use advice to open a location to expand. I will classify transit locations by inputting station
latitude and longitudes to the foursquare API. Then use foursquare to get the nearest venues then get the 
categories for the nearest venues. The location will be classified by the most prevalent category.

Therefore, business owners in the restaurant industry
would be interested in this project. Using this recommender system 
will tell them whether a certain location is a good place to open a new venue.
