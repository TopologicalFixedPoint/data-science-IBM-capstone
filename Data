The data that I hope to use is primarily the foursquare api to get the 
location of restaurants based on category. I will also use the Metropolitan
Transit Authority of New York API to get information on public transit in New 
York City. Additionally I will use the Bay Area Rapid Transit API to get public transit 
information for San Franscisco. Finally, I will use the LA metro api to get information in Los Angeles.
Based on the those 3 cities I feel I would have enough of a sample to apply to most cities.
